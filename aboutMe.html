    	  <p>My name is Farrah Jean and I am constantly trying to challenge myself and what I can do in life. 
          I see no limitations as I grow wiser.</p>
        <p>I got my BA degree from University of Massachusetts - Boston in Social Psychology and I minored in Communication studies.
          But before I even set my eyes on those subjects, I had initially went to school for engineering but more 
          so for Textile Engineering. I did end up switching but I always was intrigued by engineering of some sort or
          another. 
          I then realized when Tumblr came out back in the day, I wanted to learn how to code. Granted time didn't allow it
          as I was still getting my BA. </p>
        <p>Finally! I had some spare time on my hands and I signed up for General Assembly's Full Stack program. Not 
          the best idea for someone just learning about the basics of coding. So I switched into the Front-End Web Development program
          that they offered. 
          I ended up loving coding and being able to control different types of environments. 
          I still hadn't felt very confident with my basic coding skills, so I applied for Resilient Coders and 
          luckily I got in! 
        </p>
        <p>I was thrilled and I, yet again, took Front-End Web Developing and eventually they promoted me to  
          become one of the three Project Managers whilst we were still in the bootcamp, except this portion of
          it was geared towards learning Wordpress, PHP, for me personally, project managerial duties and soft skills.
          Now I am currently trying to learn the back-end on a better note. </p>
        <p>I also want to delve into the Blockchain, UI/UX, SEO, and AI/ 3D realm a bit more. I want to become 
          extremely tech savvy and resourceful for others. 
          Please don't hesitate to contact me for a position! </p>
