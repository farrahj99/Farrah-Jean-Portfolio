# Farrah Jean's Portfolio

Here is the live preview of my portfolio with a few projects! https://farrahj99.github.io/Farrah-Jean-Portfolio/


## Installation:
You can 'git clone' or save the .zip file. Then open up the files onto your coding editor. 

## Usage:
This is my portfolio but feel free to download it and revamp it as you please!  

## Support:
For any questions, find me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farrah-jean/)

## Roadmap:
I did it for the class I am taking but I think I will go back and add more features and work on the grid and aligning it better.
